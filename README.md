# Hi Random CurseForge User! I'm Dad!
As a 20+ year "*Dad*", I enjoy a good (_bad_) "***Dad Joke***". As such I started using them to congratulate guildies when they made an achievement in-game and it turned into a running gag.

The problem is that coming up with them on-the-fly was getting tedious, and keeping track of them all grew almost impossible over the years.

## DadGratz is born!
With the help of some of my own know-how, and ["TheMcGratzer"](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/the-mcgratzer) for inspiration, DadGratz came to be.

I have used a lot of the jokes from TheMcGratzer for the "nice" jokes/gratzes in the base installation as they did a tremendous job on collecting/creating so many, so credit goes to [Arky3001](https://www.curseforge.com/members/arky3001/projects) for them; I have also added my own as well for the base installation.

## Options
You have the ability to add your own custom gratz for your guild(s) specifically, and the ability to use a per profile setup as well if you have toons in different guilds and want to keep your custom gratzes separate from each other (perhaps one guild is a bit more open with their jokes, and one is more strict). You can also turn off the naughty and dark gratz if you wish.

Additionally, you have the ability to adjust the "weights" of the randomizer to have specific gratz types show up more often, or less than, the other types.

### Misc
Feel free to help out with the translations, and if you have any requests to add to the functionality, please let me know.

One caveat:  I will ***NOT*** be adding the functionality to gratz anywhere outside of the toon's guild.  Period.  This is non-negotiable. If you want that, you may fork this on GitHub and add that for yourself, but I won't be doing it.

If you have a good gratz joke that you want to share with the base installation, add it in the localizations under the English language and if, after review, I approve it, it will be in the next release (I'll even credit the individual jokesters).
