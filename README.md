As a 20+ year "Dad", I enjoy a good (bad) "Dad Joke". As such I started using them to congratulate guildies when they made an achievement in-game and it turned into a running gag.

The problem is that coming up with them on-the-fly was getting tedious, and keeping track of them all grew almost impossible over the years. So I put together this addon for myself.

I've decided to release it to the world with some features to come.
